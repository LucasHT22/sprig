I don't want a lot for Sprigmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents underneath the Sprigmas tree
I just want sprig for my own
More than sprig could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Sprigmas is sprig
Yeah
I don't want a lot for Sprigmas
There is just one thing I need (and I)
Don't care about the presents underneath the Sprigmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Sprigmas Day
I just want sprig for my own
More than sprig could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Sprigmas is sprig
sprig, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Sprigmas
I won't even wish for snow (and I)
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want sprig here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Sprigmas is sprig
sprig, baby
Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't sprig bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
Won't sprig please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Sprigmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want sprig for my own
More than sprig could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh, baby, all I want for Sprigmas is sprig
sprig, baby
All I want for Sprigmas is sprig, baby
All I want for Sprigmas is sprig, baby
All I want for Sprigmas is sprig, baby
All I want for Sprigmas (all I really want) is sprig, baby
All I want (I want) for Sprigmas (all I really want) is sprig, baby
