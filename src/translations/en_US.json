The Sprig game engine exposes a small construction kit for making tile-based games. This construction kit helps you focus on being creative instead of learning big APIs. The games are just JavaScript and we built a custom system to run that same JavaScript on the microcontroller!",

Each kit includes parts needed for getting started with hardware engineering and embedded systems programming. This includes a Raspberry Pi Pico, a TFT7735 screen, a MAX98357A I2S class D audio amplifier, a whole bunch of buttons, LEDs, a speaker, and a carrier board which wires all these components together while exposing the remaining pins on the microcontroller. It’s a complete system for generating graphics, sound, and handling tactile inputs which is reprogrammable at the touch of a button.",
